Context:
It is vital for the Cars4U business to have an accurate model to predict the prices of their used cars. They do not want to price their cars too high, otherwise customers will not buy them and their business will be low. On the flip side, they do not want their car prices to be too low, otherwise the business will lose potential money on a lot of their sales. Therefore, this model will accurately price used cars so that the business can sell them for the best price.

Objective:
The intended goal is to create a pricing model that can predict the price of a used car based on the features of the car, which can help the business sell used cars for the most ideal price for profitability.
